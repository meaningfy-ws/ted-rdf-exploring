== Jupyter Notebook - Python

This section shows an example of using TED data in a Python Jupyter Notebook. The
Jupyter Notebook is an application for creating and sharing
computational documents. Python represents a programming language for
writing computational documents. To realize the proposed scenario, it is
necessary to install the special tools and use the Python code that will
perform a query to the Cellar endpoint and display the results in tabular
form (xref:references-python[Working with Jupyter Notebook]).

To run Python sample:

[arabic]
. Download Jupyter Notebook file:

https://github.com/OP-TED/ted-rdf-conversion-pipeline/blob/main/notebooks/query_cellar_python.ipynb[[.underline]#https://github.com/OP-TED/ted-rdf-conversion-pipeline/blob/main/notebooks/query_cellar_python.ipynb#]

[arabic, start=2]
. Download & Install Python 3.8:
[loweralpha]
.. Windows 64bit:
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.10/python-3.8.10-amd64.exe[[.underline]#download#]

.. Windows 86bit:
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.10/python-3.8.10.exe[[.underline]#download#]

. Open Jupyter Notebook file with code editor (VS Code):

. In code editor, select interpreter for Python that was installed

Example in VS Code:

image:python/image8.png[image,width=617,height=204]

[arabic, start=5]
. Install dependencies:

* Use OS command line and type:
[source,python]
pip install ipykernel sparqlwrapper pandas

[arabic, start=6]
. Run Cells (example in VS Code):

image:python/image62.png[image,width=601,height=84]

If all works good, on last output cell we can see results:

image:python/image2.png[image,width=387,height=420]
