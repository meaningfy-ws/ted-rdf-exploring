== Jupyter Notebook - R

This section shows an example using Jupyter Notebook in R language. R is
software environment for statistical computing and graphic
representation. In this case, R represents the programming language for
writing notebook documents. To realize the proposed scenario, it is
necessary to install the special tools (xref:references-r[Running R Jupyter Notebooks]) and
use the R code that will perform a query (xref:references-r[SPARQL with R]) to
the cellar and display the results in tabular form.

To run R sample:

[arabic]
. Install & install R language:

* Windows 64bit:
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-4.2.2-win.exe[[.underline]#download#]

[arabic, start=2]
. Download Jupyter Notebook file:
https://github.com/OP-TED/ted-rdf-conversion-pipeline/blob/main/notebooks/query_cellar_R.ipynb[[.underline]#https://github.com/OP-TED/ted-rdf-conversion-pipeline/blob/main/notebooks/query_cellar_R.ipynb#]

[arabic, start=3]
. Download SPARQL package archive and put in same folder as Notebook file:
https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/SPARQL/SPARQL_1.16.tar.gz[[.underline]#download SPARQL#]

[arabic, start=4]
. Install IRKernel:

[loweralpha]
.. Run R in OS command line and type:
[source,bash]
install.packages("IRkernel")
install.packages('RCurl')
install.packages('XML')

[loweralpha, start=2]
. In appeared window, select the first mirror and press OK:

[loweralpha, start=3]
. After installation is completed, type:
[source,bash]
IRkernel::installspec()


[arabic, start=5]
. Open Jupyter Notebook file in your favourite code editor (e.g VS Code);

. Select R interpreter;

[arabic, start=7]
. Run All the Notebook Cells (example in VS Code):

image:r/image90.png[image,width=502,height=100]

After the execution on last output cell we can see results:
